# Cardinality-Regularization-in-Residual-Network

This is my thesis for my major in the undergraduate term. This work proposes some regularization methods in ResNeXt from the cardinality dimension.

To complete this work and compare with other competitive results from different models, I also reproduce some related models including ResNets, ResNeXts and Stochastic Depth.
