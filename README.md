# Stochastic-Cardinality-in-Residual-Network

This is my thesis for my major in the undergraduate term. This work proposes a new regularization method in ResNeXt from the cardinality dimension which is called Stochastic Cardinality. It's very similar to another regularization method Stochastic Depth. The only difference is that Stochastic Depth deals with the depth dimension but Stochastic Cardinality deals with the cardinality dimension.

To complete this work and compare with other competitive results from different models, I also reproduce some related models including ResNets, ResNeXts and Stochastic Depth.
